Minimal [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) sample app.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) (and above)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `de.codecentric.springbootsample.Application` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Docker Compose Usage

### Starting the Environment:

To start the development environment, use the `docker-compose up` command. This command will read the `docker-compose.yml` file and create the necessary containers according to the specified configuration.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Once the containers are up and running, you can access to the application APIs through the URL [http://localhost:port](http://localhost:port), where "port" is the port specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Stopping and Cleaning up the Environment:

When you're done working with the application, you can stop and clean up the containers using the `docker-compose down` command. This will release the resources used by the containers and remove them instantly.

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Remember to execute this command from the same directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

## Deploying the application to OpenShift

The easiest way to deploy the sample application to OpenShift is to use the [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/index.html):

```shell
oc new-app codecentric/springboot-maven3-centos~https://github.com/codecentric/springboot-sample-app
```

This will create:

* An ImageStream called "springboot-maven3-centos"
* An ImageStream called "springboot-sample-app"
* A BuildConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* DeploymentConfig called "springboot-sample-app"
* Service called "springboot-sample-app"

If you want to access the app from outside your OpenShift installation, you have to expose the springboot-sample-app service:

```shell
oc expose springboot-sample-app --hostname=www.example.com
```
